                    <p>var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope.</p>

                    <h1>What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
                    <img src="img/REST API.png" alt="">
                    <p>Application Programme Interface abbreviated as API which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.</p>
                    <h3>Example :</h3>
                    <p> If user wants to book train tickets, web application shows the departure time, stations like that all the informations, when we look in this from the developer side, developer wants to display all the train schedule informations in the web application, then developer use the APIs to get these train informations from the web server where all the train details and informations are stored. Then developers can retrieve data from the web server using the APIs to display in the web application.</p>
                    <h3>What is REST API? :</h3>
                    <p>REpresentational State Transfer abbreviated to REST. It is an API that follows a set of rules for an application and services to communicate with each other.</p>
                    <p>REST APIs work by fielding requests for a resource and returning all relevant information about the resource, translated into a format that clients can easily interpret (this format is determined by the API receiving requests). Clients can also modify items on the server and even add new items to the server through a REST API.</p>
